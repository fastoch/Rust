## Course Goals

- Getting familiar with core concepts and syntax
- Data Types & Data Structures
- Ownership & Borrowing
- Allocating data to memory and accessing data from memory
- Standard Library
- Generics, Traits, Lifetimes, Closures, and much more

## Why learning Rust?

- Fastest language after C
- Rich type system
- No garbage collector (faster runtime)
- Useful compiler output
- Guarantees Memory safety
- Most beloved programming language since 2016 (according to Stack Overflow)
- Fast adoption in various branches

## Recommended Resources (already in my whishlist)

- The Rust Programming Language (book covering the basics - 2nd edition)
- Rust for Rustaceans (book introducing more advanced concepts)
- https://practice.course.rs/why-exercise.html
- https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021

# Variables

- variables are assigned using the `let` keyword	
- print to standard output using `println!` or `print!`
- the scope of a variable is the block of code in which it is declared
- a **function** is a named block of code that is **reusable**
- **shadowing** allows a variable to be re-declared in the **same scope** with the **same name**

## Writing our first Rust program

- see `firstProgram.rs` file
- every Rust program starts with a `main` function
```rust	
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
